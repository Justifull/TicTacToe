# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Tic-Tac-Toe Minigame with AI.

The picking algorithm for the optimal and best move is based on the "Min-Max-Algorithm". (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax-Algorithmus)

It is my one implementation, but the workflow is similar.
Feel free to tell me about errors and your wins, so I could fix them.
